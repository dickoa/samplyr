This dataset is designed for demonstrating:
\itemize{
\item Business/enterprise surveys
\item Stratification by sector and size class
\item PPS sampling using employment
\item Geographic stratification by zone/state
}

The distribution reflects typical business demographics with majority
micro/small enterprises, concentrated in South West (especially Lagos).
}

data values are fictional.

\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{sampling_design} object (piped from \code{\link[=sampling_design]{sampling_design()}},
\code{\link[=stratify_by]{stratify_by()}}, or \code{\link[=cluster_by]{cluster_by()}}).}

\item{n}{Sample size. For random-size methods (\code{bernoulli}, \code{pps_poisson}),
\code{n} is the \strong{expected} sample size (converted internally to \code{frac = n / N}).
Can be:
\itemize{
\item A scalar: applies per stratum (if no \code{alloc}) or as total (if \code{alloc} specified)
\item A named vector: stratum-specific sizes (for single stratification variable)
\item A data frame: stratum-specific sizes with stratification columns + \code{n} column
}}

\item{frac}{Sampling fraction. Can be:
\itemize{
\item A scalar: same fraction for all strata
\item A named vector: stratum-specific fractions
\item A data frame: stratum-specific fractions with stratification columns + \code{frac} column
Only one of \code{n} or \code{frac} should be specified.
}}

\item{min_n}{Minimum sample size per stratum. When an allocation method
(e.g., Neyman, proportional) would assign fewer than \code{min_n} units to a
stratum, that stratum receives \code{min_n} units instead. The excess is
redistributed proportionally among strata that were above \code{min_n}.
Commonly set to 2 (minimum for variance estimation) or higher for
reliable subgroup estimates. Only applies when stratification with an
allocation method is used. Default is \code{NULL} (no minimum).}

\item{max_n}{Maximum sample size per stratum. When an allocation method
would assign more than \code{max_n} units to a stratum, that stratum is
capped at \code{max_n} units. The surplus is redistributed proportionally
among strata that were below \code{max_n}. Useful for capping dominant strata
or managing operational constraints. Only applies when stratification
with an allocation method is used. Default is \code{NULL} (no maximum).}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the selection method. One of:

\strong{Equal probability methods:}
\itemize{
\item \code{"srswor"} (default): Simple random sampling without replacement
\item \code{"srswr"}: Simple random sampling with replacement
\item \code{"systematic"}: Systematic (fixed interval) sampling
\item \code{"bernoulli"}: Independent Bernoulli trials (random sample size)
}

\strong{PPS methods (require \code{mos}):}
\itemize{
\item \code{"pps_systematic"}: PPS systematic sampling
\item \code{"pps_brewer"}: Generalized Brewer (\enc{Tillé}{Tille}) method
\item \code{"pps_cps"}: Conditional Poisson sampling (maximum entropy)
\item \code{"pps_poisson"}: PPS Poisson sampling (random sample size)
\item \code{"pps_sps"}: Sequential Poisson sampling (fixed size, supports \code{prn})
\item \code{"pps_pareto"}: Pareto sampling (fixed size, supports \code{prn})
\item \code{"pps_multinomial"}: PPS multinomial (with replacement, any hit count)
\item \code{"pps_chromy"}: Chromy's sequential PPS (minimum replacement)
}}

\item{mos}{Measure of size variable for PPS methods, specified as a bare
column name (unquoted). Required for all \verb{pps_*} methods.}

\item{prn}{Permanent random number variable for sample coordination,
specified as a bare column name (unquoted). Must be a numeric column
with values in the open interval (0, 1) and no missing values.
Supported methods: \code{"bernoulli"}, \code{"pps_poisson"}, \code{"pps_sps"},
\code{"pps_pareto"}. When supplied, the sample is deterministic for a given
set of PRN values, enabling coordination across survey waves.}

\item{round}{Rounding method when converting \code{frac} to sample sizes.
One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"up"} (default): Round up (ceiling). Matches SAS SURVEYSELECT default.
\item \code{"down"}: Round down (floor).
\item \code{"nearest"}: Round to nearest integer (standard rounding).
}

This parameter only affects designs using \code{frac} to specify the sampling
rate. When \code{n} is specified directly, no rounding occurs.}

\item{control}{<\code{\link[dplyr:dplyr_data_masking]{data-masking}}> Variables for
sorting the frame before selection. Control sorting provides implicit
stratification, which is particularly effective with systematic and
sequential sampling methods. Can be:
\itemize{
\item A single variable: \code{control = region}
\item Multiple variables: \code{control = c(region, district)}
\item With \code{\link[=serp]{serp()}} for serpentine sorting: \code{control = serp(region, district)}
\item With \code{\link[dplyr:desc]{dplyr::desc()}} for descending: \code{control = c(region, desc(population))}
\item Mixed: \code{control = c(region, serp(district, commune), desc(size))}
}

When stratification is also specified, control sorting is applied within
each stratum. See the section "Control Sorting" below for details.}

\item{certainty_size}{For PPS without-replacement methods, units with MOS >= this value
are selected with certainty (probability = 1). Can be:
\itemize{
\item A scalar: same threshold for all strata
\item A data frame: stratum-specific thresholds with stratification columns
\itemize{
\item \code{certainty_size} column
}
}

Certainty units are removed from the frame before probability sampling,
and the remaining sample size is reduced accordingly.
Mutually exclusive with \code{certainty_prop}.
Equivalent to SAS SURVEYSELECT \verb{CERTSIZE=} option.}

\item{certainty_prop}{For PPS without-replacement methods, units whose MOS proportion
(MOS_i / sum(MOS)) >= this value are selected with certainty. Can be:
\itemize{
\item A scalar between 0 and 1 (exclusive): same threshold for all strata
\item A data frame: stratum-specific thresholds with stratification columns
\itemize{
\item \code{certainty_prop} column
}
}

Uses iterative selection: after removing certainty units, proportions are
recomputed and the check is repeated until no new units qualify.
Mutually exclusive with \code{certainty_size}.
Equivalent to SAS SURVEYSELECT \verb{CERTSIZE=P=} option.}

\item{certainty_overflow}{Controls behavior when certainty units exceed the
target sample size \code{n}. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"error"} (default): Stop with an informative error.
\item \code{"allow"}: Return all certainty units with weight 1, even if the
resulting sample has more than \code{n} units.
}

Equivalent to SAS SURVEYSELECT allowing \verb{CERTSIZE=} overflow.}

\item{on_empty}{Behaviour when a random-size method (\code{bernoulli},
\code{pps_poisson}) selects zero units in a stratum or the whole frame.
One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"error"} (default): Stop with an informative error. Zero selections
usually indicate a design problem (sampling fraction too small or
stratum too small) that should be fixed rather than silently papered
over.
\item \code{"warn"}: Issue a warning and fall back to SRS of 1 unit.
\item \code{"silent"}: Fall back to SRS of 1 unit without a message.
}

\strong{Weight note:} when falling back (\code{"warn"} or \code{"silent"}), the
fallback selects 1 unit via SRS, so the resulting weight is \code{N}
(the stratum or frame size), not \code{1/frac}. This reflects the actual
selection mechanism, not the intended Bernoulli/Poisson design.
Downstream variance estimation treats this unit as an SRS draw.}

\value{
A modified \code{sampling_design} object with selection parameters specified.

\description{
\code{draw()} specifies how units are selected: sample size, sampling fraction,
selection method, and measure of size for PPS sampling. Every stage in a
sampling design must end with \code{draw()}.

\subsection{Fixed vs Random Sample Size Methods}{

Methods with \strong{fixed sample size} (\code{srswor}, \code{srswr}, \code{systematic}, \code{pps_systematic},
\code{pps_brewer}, \code{pps_cps}, \code{pps_sps}, \code{pps_pareto}, \code{pps_multinomial}, \code{pps_chromy})
accept either \code{n} or \code{frac}. When \code{frac}
is provided, the sample size is computed based on the \code{round} parameter (default: ceiling).

Methods with \strong{random sample size} (\code{bernoulli}, \code{pps_poisson}) accept either
\code{n} or \code{frac}. When \code{n} is provided, it is converted to \code{frac = n / N} (where
\code{N} is the stratum or frame size). The resulting sample size is still random:
\code{n} specifies the \strong{expected} sample size, not a fixed count.

For \code{pps_poisson}, the raw inclusion probabilities are computed as
\eqn{\pi_i = f \cdot x_i / \bar{x}}{pi_i = f * x_i / mean(x)} where
\eqn{f} is \code{frac} and \eqn{x_i} is the MOS value. Any \eqn{\pi_i > 1}
is clipped to 1, so the expected sample size
\eqn{E[n] = \sum \min(\pi_i, 1)}{E[n] = sum(min(pi_i, 1))} can be less
than \eqn{f \cdot N}{f * N} when large units dominate the MOS
distribution. Use \code{certainty_size} or \code{certainty_prop} to handle these
dominant units explicitly.

When an allocation method is set in \code{\link[=stratify_by]{stratify_by()}} (\code{equal},
\code{proportional}, \code{neyman}, \code{optimal}, \code{power}), specify total sample size via \code{n}.
Combining \code{alloc} with \code{frac} is not supported.
}

\subsection{Custom Allocation with Data Frames}{

For stratum-specific sample sizes or rates, pass a data frame to \code{n} or \code{frac}.
The data frame must contain:
\itemize{
\item All stratification variable columns (matching those in \code{stratify_by()})
\item An \code{n} column (for sizes) or \code{frac} column (for rates)
}
}

\subsection{Certainty Selection}{

In PPS without-replacement sampling, very large units can have theoretical
inclusion probabilities exceeding 1. Certainty selection handles this by
selecting such units with probability 1 before sampling the remainder.
The output includes a \code{.certainty_k} column (where \code{k} is the stage number)
indicating which units were certainty selections.

Certainty selection is only available for WOR PPS methods (\code{pps_systematic},
\code{pps_brewer}, \code{pps_cps}, \code{pps_poisson}, \code{pps_sps}, \code{pps_pareto}). With-replacement methods
(\code{pps_multinomial}) and PMR methods (\code{pps_chromy}) handle large units
natively through their hit mechanism.

When \code{certainty_overflow = "allow"}, if more units qualify for certainty
selection than the requested \code{n}, all certainty units are returned with
probability 1 (weight = 1). No probabilistic sampling is performed in
this case. The resulting sample size will be the number of certainty
units, which exceeds \code{n}.

For stratum-specific thresholds, pass a data frame containing:
\itemize{
\item All stratification variable columns
\item A \code{certainty_size} or \code{certainty_prop} column
}
}

\subsection{Control Sorting}{

Control sorting orders the sampling frame before selection, providing implicit
stratification. This is particularly effective with systematic and sequential
methods (\code{systematic}, \code{pps_systematic}, \code{pps_chromy}), where it ensures the
sample spreads evenly across the sorted variables.

\strong{Serpentine vs Nested Sorting:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Nested} (default): Standard ascending sort by each variable in order.
Use \code{control = c(var1, var2, var3)}.
\item \strong{Serpentine}: Alternating direction that minimizes "jumps" between
adjacent units. Use \code{control = serp(var1, var2, var3)}.
}

Serpentine sorting makes nearby observations more similar by reversing
direction at each hierarchy level. For geographic hierarchies, this means
the last district of region 1 is adjacent to the last district of region 2.

\strong{Combining with Explicit Stratification:}
When both \code{stratify_by()} and \code{control} are used, sorting is applied within
each stratum. This allows explicit stratification for variance control
combined with implicit stratification for sample spread.

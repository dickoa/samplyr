\description{
A synthetic school survey frame inspired by education census and survey data.
Uses real Tanzania regions and districts but contains entirely fictional data.
}
\details{
This dataset is designed for demonstrating:
\itemize{
\item Education surveys
\item Two-stage sampling (schools then students)
\item PPS sampling using enrollment
\item Stratification by school level and ownership
}

The dataset reflects typical East African education system characteristics
with more primary than secondary schools, and infrastructure varying by
urban/rural location.
}
\note{
This is a synthetic dataset. Regions and districts are real but all
data values are fictional.

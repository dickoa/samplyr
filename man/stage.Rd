\title{Define a New Stage in Multi-Stage Designs}
\usage{
stage(.data, label = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{sampling_design} object.}

\item{label}{Optional character string labeling the stage (e.g., "Schools",
"Classrooms", "Students"). Used for documentation and printing.}
}
\value{
A modified \code{sampling_design} object with a new stage context.
}
\description{
\code{stage()} opens a new stage context in multi-stage sampling designs.
It acts as a delimiter between stages, not a wrapper—each stage's
specification follows \code{stage()} using the same verbs.
}
\details{
\subsection{Multi-Stage Design Structure}{

In multi-stage designs, sampling proceeds hierarchically:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Stage 1}: Select primary sampling units (PSUs), e.g., schools
\item \strong{Stage 2}: Within selected PSUs, select secondary units, e.g., classrooms
\item \strong{Stage 3+}: Continue nesting as needed
}

Each stage can have its own:
\itemize{
\item Stratification (\code{\link[=stratify_by]{stratify_by()}})
\item Clustering (\code{\link[=cluster_by]{cluster_by()}})
\item Selection method and sample size (\code{\link[=draw]{draw()}})
}
}

\subsection{Design Patterns}{

\strong{Pattern 1: Single-stage (no explicit \code{stage()}):}
\preformatted{
sampling_design() |>
  stratify_by(...) |>
  draw(...)
}

\strong{Pattern 2: Multi-stage (explicit stages):}
\preformatted{
sampling_design() |>
  stage(label = "Stage 1") |>
    cluster_by(...) |>
    draw(...) |>
  stage(label = "Stage 2") |>
    cluster_by(...) |>
    draw(...) |>
  stage(label = "Stage 3") |>
    draw(...)
}
}

\subsection{Validation Rules}{
\itemize{
\item Each stage must end with \code{\link[=draw]{draw()}} before the next \code{stage()} or \code{\link[=execute]{execute()}}
\item Empty stages (stage followed immediately by stage) are not allowed
\item The final stage doesn't need \code{cluster_by()} (samples individuals)
}
}
}
\section{Execution}{

Multi-stage designs can be executed:
\itemize{
\item All at once with a single frame (hierarchical data)
\item All at once with multiple frames (one per stage)
\item Stage by stage using \verb{stages =} parameter in \code{\link[=execute]{execute()}}
}

See \code{\link[=execute]{execute()}} for details on execution patterns.

\description{
A synthetic health facility frame inspired by Service Provision Assessment
(SPA) and Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) surveys.
Uses real Kenya counties but contains entirely fictional data.
}
\details{
This dataset is designed for demonstrating:
\itemize{
\item Health facility surveys
\item Stratification by facility type and region
\item PPS sampling using patient volume
\item Sampling across different ownership types
}

Facility types follow the Kenyan health system hierarchy from referral
hospitals down to dispensaries and clinics.
}
\note{
This is a synthetic dataset. Counties and regions are real but all
data values are fictional.

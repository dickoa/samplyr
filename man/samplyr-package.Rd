\title{samplyr: A Tidy Grammar for Survey Sampling}
\description{
Provides a tidy, composable grammar for specifying and executing complex survey sampling designs. Supports stratified, clustered, multi-stage, and multi-phase sampling with a minimal set of verbs that compose naturally. Designed to bridge the gap between verbal descriptions of sampling plans and executable R code, following tidyverse design principles. Includes synthetic sampling frames from African countries (Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Kenya) for learning and testing.

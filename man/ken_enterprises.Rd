\details{
This dataset is designed for demonstrating:
\itemize{
\item Enterprise/business surveys
\item Stratification by sector and size class
\item PPS sampling using employment or revenue
\item Disproportionate sampling (oversampling large enterprises)
\item PRN-based sample coordination across survey waves
\item Panel partitioning with \code{execute(..., panels = k)}
\item Bernoulli and Poisson sampling
}

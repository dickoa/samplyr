\title{Niger Enumeration Areas (DHS-style)}
\format{
A tibble with approximately 1,500 rows and 6 columns:
\describe{
\item{ea_id}{Character. Unique enumeration area identifier}
\item{region}{Factor. Region name (8 regions: Agadez, Diffa, Dosso, Maradi, Niamey, Tahoua, \enc{Tillabéri}{Tillaberi}, Zinder)}
\item{department}{Factor. Department name within region}
\item{strata}{Factor. Urban/Rural stratification}
\item{hh_count}{Integer. Number of households in the EA (measure of size for PPS)}
\item{pop_estimate}{Integer. Estimated population}
}
}
\usage{
niger_eas
}
\description{
A synthetic enumeration area (EA) frame for household surveys, inspired by
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) sampling designs. Uses real Niger
administrative divisions but contains entirely fictional data.
}
\details{
This dataset is designed for demonstrating:
\itemize{
\item Stratified multi-stage cluster sampling
\item PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling using household counts
\item Urban/rural stratification
\item Two-stage designs (EAs then households)
}

The data structure mirrors typical DHS sampling frames where enumeration
areas are the primary sampling units, selected with probability proportional
to the number of households.
}
\note{
This is a synthetic dataset created for demonstration purposes. While it uses
real Niger administrative divisions, all data values are fictional.

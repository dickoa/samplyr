\title{Zimbabwe Households (Two-Phase Subframe)}
\format{
A tibble with 379,326 rows and 9 columns:
\describe{
\item{hh_id}{Character. Unique household identifier}
\item{ea_id}{Character. Enumeration area identifier (links to \link{zwe_eas})}
\item{province}{Factor. Province name}
\item{district}{Factor. District name}
\item{urban_rural}{Factor. Urban/Rural classification}
\item{hh_size}{Integer. Number of household members}
\item{n_children}{Integer. Number of children under 5}

\item{has_improved_water}{Logical. Whether the household has improved water access}
}
}
\usage{
zwe_households
}
\description{
A household-level frame for a subset of 2,000 enumeration areas from
\link{zwe_eas}. Designed for demonstrating two-phase sampling, where phase 1
selects EAs and phase 2 subsamples households within selected EAs.
}
\details{
This dataset is designed for demonstrating:
\itemize{
\item Two-phase sampling (EA selection followed by household subsampling)
\item Joint inclusion probability computation
\item Survey export with multi-stage designs
}

Only a subset of EAs from \link{zwe_eas} have household-level data, reflecting
the operational reality where household listing is done only in selected EAs.

\title{Niger Households (DHS-style)}
\format{
A tibble with approximately 150,000 rows and 9 columns:
\describe{
\item{hh_id}{Character. Unique household identifier}
\item{ea_id}{Character. Parent enumeration area identifier (links to \link{niger_eas})}
\item{region}{Factor. Region name}
\item{department}{Factor. Department name}
\item{strata}{Factor. Urban/Rural stratification}
\item{hh_size}{Integer. Number of persons in household}
\item{head_age}{Integer. Age of household head (18-85)}
\item{head_sex}{Factor. Sex of household head (Male/Female)}
\item{n_children_u5}{Integer. Number of children under 5 years}
}
}
\usage{
niger_households
}
\description{
A synthetic household-level dataset nested within \link{niger_eas}. Each row
represents one household, enabling true two-stage cluster sampling
demonstrations where EAs are selected first, then households within
selected EAs.
}
\details{
This dataset is designed for demonstrating:
\itemize{
\item True two-stage cluster sampling (EAs then households)
\item Joining cluster-level and unit-level data
\item Within-cluster subsampling
}

The number of households per EA matches the \code{hh_count} variable in
\link{niger_eas}, ensuring consistency between the EA frame and household
listing.

\note{
This is a synthetic dataset. All values are fictional.

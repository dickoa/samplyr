\title{Create a Sampling Design}
\usage{
sampling_design(title = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{Optional character string providing a title for the design.
Useful for documentation and printing purposes.}
}
\value{
A \code{sampling_design} object that can be piped to other design
functions.
}
\description{
\code{sampling_design()} is the entry point for creating survey sampling
specifications. It creates an empty design object that can be built
up using pipe-able verbs like \code{\link[=stratify_by]{stratify_by()}}, \code{\link[=cluster_by]{cluster_by()}},
\code{\link[=draw]{draw()}}, and \code{\link[=stage]{stage()}}.
}
\details{
The sampling design paradigm separates the specification of a sampling
plan from its execution. This allows designs to be:
\itemize{
\item Reused across different data frames
\item Partially executed (e.g., stage by stage)
\item Inspected and validated before execution
\item Documented and shared
}

The design specification is frame-independent: it describes \emph{how} to sample,
not \emph{what} to sample from.

\section{Design Flow}{

A typical design workflow follows this pattern:
\preformatted{
sampling_design() |>
  stratify_by(...) |>
  cluster_by(...) |>
  draw(...) |>
  execute(frame)
}
}

\examples{
# Simple random sample of 100 health facilities
sampling_design() |>
  draw(n = 100) |>
  execute(kenya_health, seed = 1)

# Stratified sample with proportional allocation
sampling_design(title = "Kenya Health Facility Survey") |>
  stratify_by(facility_type, alloc = "proportional") |>
  draw(n = 400) |>
  execute(kenya_health, seed = 2)

# Two-stage cluster sample of schools and students
sampling_design(title = "Tanzania Education Survey") |>
  stage(label = "Schools") |>
    cluster_by(school_id) |>
    draw(n = 50, method = "pps_brewer", mos = enrollment) |>
  stage(label = "Students") |>
    draw(n = 20) |>
  execute(tanzania_schools, seed = 3)

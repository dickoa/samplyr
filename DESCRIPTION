Description: Provides a tidy, composable grammar for specifying and executing
    complex survey sampling designs. Supports stratified, clustered, multi-stage,
    and multi-phase sampling with a minimal set of verbs that compose naturally.
    Designed to bridge the gap between verbal descriptions of sampling plans
    and executable R code, following tidyverse design principles. Includes
    synthetic sampling frames from African countries (Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe,
    Kenya) for learning and testing.
